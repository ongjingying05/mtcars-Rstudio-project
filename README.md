# mtcars-Rstudio-project
In this Rstudio case study project, I will be performing basic exploratory data analysis on the mtcars dataset from Rstudio’s default datasets package. Afterward, I will create a Rnotebook to document my entire visualisation & analysis process.

The mtcars (Motor Trend Car Road Tests) dataset was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trends US magazine, 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models). (11 columns x 32 rows).

Analysis questions to answer:  
+ Does fuel efficiency decrease with higher horsepower?  
+ How significant is the effect of weight on fuel efficiency? Is it more than horsepower?  
+ Does transmission type affect fuel efficiency?

Do view the 'mtcars.md' file for my HTML documentation for this project 🙂
